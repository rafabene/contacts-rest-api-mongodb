# contacts-rest-api-mongodb
Demo API that stores contact data in MongoDB

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/ .

## Start a MongoDB container

This application requires a MongoDB to store date. You can have your own mongodb running it as a container with the following command:

    docker run -ti --rm -p 27017:27017 mongo:4.4

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```

The application, packaged as an _Ã¼ber-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.
